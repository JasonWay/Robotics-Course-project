Haze can cause poor visibility and loss of contrast in images and videos. In this article, we study the dehazing problem which can improve visibility and thus help in many computer vision applications. An extensive comparison of state of the art single image dehazing methods is done. One simple contrast enhancement method is used for dehazing. Structure- texture decomposition has been used in conjunction with this enhancement method to improve its performance in presence of synthetic noise. Methods which use a haze formation model and attempt at solving an ill-posed problem using computer vision priors are also investigated. The two priors studied are dark channel prior and the non-local prior. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons for atmospheric and underwater images on all three methods provide a conclusive idea of which dehazing method performs better. All this knowledge has been extended to video dehazing. A video dehazing method which uses the spatial and temporal information in a video is studied in depth. An improved version of video dehazing is proposed in this article, which uses the spatial-temporal information fusion framework but does not suffer from some of its limitations. The new video dehazing method is shown to produce better results on test videos
